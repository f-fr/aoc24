# Advent of Code 2024

My solution, this time in [FreePascal][fp]. My personal goal is to keep the running
time for each day well below 0.1s (on my Raspberry Pi 2).

All solutions can be run using the single executable `aoc24`.

The simplest way to compile the program is executing

    fppkg build

in the base directory. Note that this will compile the program with the default
options (which may not be release mode).
